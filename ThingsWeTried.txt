Things We Tried:



Things Currently Installed:

- Libfreenect (https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) 
- avconv
Currently works : 
- http://askubuntu.com/questions/162785/record-and-display-kinect-audio-and-video-via-avconv // record data from Kinect
- omxplayer (videoname).mp4 // plays the recorded video

Currently Trying:

- trying to use avconv to capture kinect video data (http://www.tecmint.com/record-ubuntu-desktop-screen-using-avconv/)
- kinect should be /dev/video0 ; unplug and replug kinect to test 
- when I try capturing the data, it either says the device "does not exist" or it can't find the directory to output to
- also, try out this again: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17743479/raspberry-pi-with-kinect
