# Physical Design of IPA Robot

Items to fit:
 - Raspberry Pi
 - Kinect
 - Speakers
 - Battery x2
 - Projector

Can use ~5 posts to suspend another circular "table" over the robot. On top of this we can place the kinect on a turntable with small motor to operate the swivel functionality. We choose to rotate the kinect rather than the projector because it will have less bulky cables to rotate usb vs hdmi

Raspberry Pi can fit in the vacuum bay on the rear underside of the robot.

Everything else can be easily fastened to the top of the robot.

There are some small motorized turntables that would be easy to drop in. We could buy a cheap sheet of polycarbonate to act as the second level for the robot.
