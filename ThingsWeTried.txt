Things We Tried:



Things Currently Installed:

- Libfreenect (https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) 
- avconv

Currently Trying:

- trying to use avconv to capture kinect video data (http://www.tecmint.com/record-ubuntu-desktop-screen-using-avconv/)
- kinect should be /dev/video0 ; unplug and replug kinect to test 
- when I try capturing the data, it either says the device "does not exist" or it can't find the directory to output to
- also, try out this again: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17743479/raspberry-pi-with-kinect
